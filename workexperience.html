        <h2>Worked as an insurance agent.</h2>
        <p><b>Date:</b>2021-2022</p>
        <p>I joined an insurance company and began working as an agent there after completing my +2 level for a year.I spent a lot of time speaking with clients answering their quiries, explaining the terms of policies and offer them full service that fullfills their need.</p>
        <p>In order to gain trust & loyalty of clients,it was quite important to keep up-to-date understanding of the most recent insurance products and regulations.It was difficult to persuade people to buy insurance as many of them thought that it was a wasteful expense.</p>
        <p>Being a shy girl who lacked confidence,I was a bit concerned before I started working.Yet as time went on,I understood that this position was ideal for me as it taught me strong communication,empathy and versatility.</p>
